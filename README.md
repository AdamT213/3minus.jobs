# 3minus.jobs
A web crawler that curates a carefully selected list of entry level jobs in dev and tech

The goal of this project is to help young/new developers find promising job leads by scraping some of the most common job sites and 
showing entries that list 3 or fewer years of experience as a requirement. These jobs can be exceptionally hard to come by if 
you are just searching through, so it is nigh time we had a better way of finding and presenting them. To that end, the specifications are
as follows: 

.This is an opinionated resource that *only* collects on information on jobs that *specifically* say, in some way, that they are open 
to junior developers. Wherever necessary, it is better to exclude a posting that is questionable than to include one that doesn't meet
these criteria. We are not trying to cultivate the *largest* possible repository of job postings, we are trying to find *only* the most 
promising ones for junior developers. Not wasting the job seeker's time is the priority. 

.The jobs here are tailored to developers. Any other roles that may be found here are incidental. 

.There is no location filter on the jobs. Jobs that are truly open to junior developers are hard to come by, and a junior developer must 
be willing and open to relocation in order to have a good chance of finding one. 

If you are not comfortable with these specifications, then this is not the job board for you. If you are,  then welcome. I hope that
this site simplifies your job search substantially. Feedback is welcome and encouraged.
